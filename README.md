Testing methods for evsi with bias using simple decision tree CE model (ades et al 2004)

#########################

This code uses the Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information method (see Strong et al 2013/15) to value clinical study designs using the example decision tree model originally published in ades et al (2004) illustrating the use of EVSI in clinical trial design. The method is extended to demonstrate how to use this approach to value studies with bias under a number of parameterisations; thus allowing observational studies to be valued in the same framework. NB doing this in practice requires you to elicit prior beliefs about the bias of your proposed study versus that of the ``idealised'' study which is simulated - this is not straightforward, see Turner et al (2009) for some ideas in context of meta-analysis.
